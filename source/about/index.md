Who is Runze Zhu anyway?

I was born and raised in a small town in China, came to Montreal in 2019 with a dream of becoming a game developer.

Passionate about video game and game development. Bought many games and haven't finsh half of them.
Participited in many Game Jams, made many small games, learned a lot, and realized that there are a lot more I need to learn.

Music is a big part of my life. I often feel that if I didn't love music, I would suffer from depression very early on. The most religious thing I will do is just staring at Spotify's lyrics page and listening to music for a long time. I also love going to live shows, collection records, spent too much money that I shouldn't have. I Played guitar for about two years when I was in elementary school. Recently trying to pick it up again.

Want to get back to reading. Currently, I'm reading [Crying In H Mart](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54814676) by Michelle Zauner. Hopefully it won't make me cry too much.
