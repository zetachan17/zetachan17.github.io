## [Iron Man Game](#iron-man-game) 
![Iron Man Game Key Art](/images/IronMan.jpg)
I am (was making) Iron Man.

This is the project that I worked on during my eight month internship at EA Motive. As a gameplay programmer intern, I had the opportunity to learn and use C++, Frostbite Engine, and Unreal Engine 5 for this project. 

I learned how to use Gameplay Ability System in Unreal Engine 5 and Blueprint to implement many features such as character health, shield, and combat resources system in. I also created some UI to display these information.

I also learned how to use Entity Component System (ECS) in a large codebase like Frostbite Engine. I implemented some features in ECS such as hit detection, combact resources, many more. I also worked on the UI helped intergrate ImGui into the game. 

I worked closely with gameplay designning team to implement these features and wrote some documentation on Confluence to help other programmers understand how to use these features.

This eight months were some of the best time of my university life. I learned a lot from my mentors and colleagues, working with them makes me realize that people in the game industry are some of the most passionate and coolest people in the world. Working on an AAA game is a dream come true for me, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity. I hope I can work on more projects like this in the future.
